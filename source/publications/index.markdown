1.**Bhatnagar S.**, Atherton J., Benedetti A (2014). _Comparing alternating logistic regressions to other approaches to modelling correlated binary data_. Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation. [doi:10.1080/00949655.2014.916707](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00949655.2014.916707#.U7_isnWx22i)

> Through a simulation study we compared alternating logistic 		regressions to marginal models estimated via generalised estimating equations and generalised linear mixed models, with a focus on estimation of the correlation structure in three-level datasets (e.g. students in classes in schools)
