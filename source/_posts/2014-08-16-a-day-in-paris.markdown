We took the evening flight from Montreal Trudeau (YUL) to Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG).

Here's the *before* picutre:

I tried to sleep as little as possible in the nights leading up to the flight to try and counteract the jet-lag but it didn't work. We had trouble sleeping in the plane so we watched Hunger Games: Catching Fire...twice. It's actually a pretty interesting movie; a comic book which depicts human nature in the face of opression. The plane food was terrible as expected. Note to self: ask for the Hindu option next time.

We landed in Paris on August 13th at 6 am, and took the [RoissyBus](http://www.aeroportsdeparis.fr/ADP/en-GB/Passagers/Access-maps-car-parks/Paris-CDG/Access/public-transport/paris-cdg-roissybus.htm) from Terminal 3 to Opera metro.

This was a nice bus ride, and allowed you to see the **normal** part of Paris: Peugeot cars, highways, people going to work in the morning, apartments, factories. It's a nice dose of reality and reminds you that Paris is more than just huge monuments, overpriced shopping and a tourist mayhem. Here's a picture of Karen thouroughly enjoying the RoissyBus.
