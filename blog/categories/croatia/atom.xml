    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am writing this post on our 4.5 hour train ride to Salzburgh from Ljubjlana. It’s tough to keep up with my blog when you’re so worn out from travelling, walking, eating and drinking. One advantage though is that you get to compare similarities and differences between cities. You start to notice the smaller things like automatic lighting in bathrooms and charging for water at restaurants.</p>

<p>Rovigno (the italian name for Rovinj; but don’t ever say Rovinj because people on this side of the Atlantic will give you weird looks and not know what you’re referring to) is on the Adriatic coast and part of the Istrian region of Croatia. There is a huge Italian influence here, and the majority of tourists are from Italy (there is a two hour ferry that goes from Venice to Rovigno). The main languages spoken here are Croatian and Italian as are the street signs. The closest airport is in Pula, just south of Rovigno. We flew to Pula from Charles de Gaulle and then our airbnb host, Slobodan, picked us up from the airport for 20 euro (about 40km from Pula). This was definetly the best option to get to Rovigno as the bus from Pula doesn’t pass that often and is confusing to plan.</p>
<p>On the way there Slobodan told us tourism was the <em>only</em> economic driver of Istria. The land isn’t fertile, at times it can rain too much, there aren’t any major companies and there’s no university in the area. After high school, students have to go study in Zagreb. Interestingly he also told us tourism is very fragile. During the Yuglosavian war in the 1990’s, tourism took a huge hit even though the actual battles were happening more than 500 km away.</p>
<h2 id="the-coast">The coast</h2>
<p>On our first day there we went to coastline. I am reluctant to call it a <em>beach</em> because the word doesn’t do it justice. The word beach reminds of sand, Sablon, Oka, people BBQ-ing and drinking. Here there’s no sand; its just rocks all along (<em>note</em>: if you ever do come here, bring water shoes that allow you to swim and walk on the rocks). People are either tanning, reading, sleeping or swimming. No one eats or drinks on the coastline. They leave that for dinner time. I have found often that people here never or rarely mix two activities together. I think this is a good example of Europeans being more relaxed than North Americans.</p>
<h2 id="old-town">Old Town</h2>
<p>This is where everything is happening and what Rovigno is most know for. Most people recognize Rovigno by the church that sits at the highest point overlooking the city on one side, and the Adriatic sea on the other. The view is stunning. We brought our lunch one day and sat on the rocks looking over the sea.</p>
<p>The town itself is full of restaurants, bars, gelato and souvenir shops. If you look a little bit you can also find local artists selling their paintings. Most of the locals are there working as waiters or waitresses. The rocks that form the cobblestone steets feel like they’ve been coated with some sort of glossy paint which leads to many falls when it rains.</p>
<p>The old town kind of gets old after a day. Unless you do research in advance, you’ll end of disappointed with the food as the majority of restaurants all have the <strong>same menu</strong>:</p>
