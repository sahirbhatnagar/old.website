<p>I tried to sleep as little as possible in the nights leading up to the flight to try and counteract the jet-lag but it didn’t work. We had trouble sleeping in the plane so we watched Hunger Games: Catching Fire…twice. It’s actually a pretty interesting movie; a comic book which depicts human nature in the face of opression. The plane food was terrible as expected. Note to self: ask for the Hindu option next time.</p>

<p>We landed in Paris on August 13th at 6 am, and took the RoissyBus from Terminal 3 to Opera metro.</p>

<p>This was a nice bus ride, and allowed you to see the <strong>normal</strong> part of Paris: Peugeot cars, highways, people going to work in the morning, apartments, factories. It’s a nice dose of reality and reminds you that Paris is more than just huge monuments, overpriced shopping and a tourist mayhem. Here’s a picture of Karen thouroughly enjoying the RoissyBus.</p>
