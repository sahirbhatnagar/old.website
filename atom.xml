    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am writing this post on our 4.5 hour train ride to Salzburgh from Ljubjlana. It’s tough to keep up with my blog when you’re so worn out from travelling, walking, eating and drinking. One advantage though is that you get to compare similarities and differences between cities. You start to notice the smaller things like automatic lighting in bathrooms and charging for water at restaurants.</p>

<p>Rovigno (the italian name for Rovinj; but don’t ever say Rovinj because people on this side of the Atlantic will give you weird looks and not know what you’re referring to) is on the Adriatic coast and part of the Istrian region of Croatia. There is a huge Italian influence here, and the majority of tourists are from Italy (there is a two hour ferry that goes from Venice to Rovigno). The main languages spoken here are Croatian and Italian as are the street signs. The closest airport is in Pula, just south of Rovigno. We flew to Pula from Charles de Gaulle and then our airbnb host, Slobodan, picked us up from the airport for 20 euro (about 40km from Pula). This was definetly the best option to get to Rovigno as the bus from Pula doesn’t pass that often and is confusing to plan.</p>
<p>On the way there Slobodan told us tourism was the <em>only</em> economic driver of Istria. The land isn’t fertile, at times it can rain too much, there aren’t any major companies and there’s no university in the area. After high school, students have to go study in Zagreb. Interestingly he also told us tourism is very fragile. During the Yuglosavian war in the 1990’s, tourism took a huge hit even though the actual battles were happening more than 500 km away.</p>
<h2 id="the-coast">The coast</h2>
<p>On our first day there we went to coastline. I am reluctant to call it a <em>beach</em> because the word doesn’t do it justice. The word beach reminds of sand, Sablon, Oka, people BBQ-ing and drinking. Here there’s no sand; its just rocks all along (<em>note</em>: if you ever do come here, bring water shoes that allow you to swim and walk on the rocks). People are either tanning, reading, sleeping or swimming. No one eats or drinks on the coastline. They leave that for dinner time. I have found often that people here never or rarely mix two activities together. I think this is a good example of Europeans being more relaxed than North Americans.</p>
<h2 id="old-town">Old Town</h2>
<p>This is where everything is happening and what Rovigno is most know for. Most people recognize Rovigno by the church that sits at the highest point overlooking the city on one side, and the Adriatic sea on the other. The view is stunning. We brought our lunch one day and sat on the rocks looking over the sea.</p>
<p>The town itself is full of restaurants, bars, gelato and souvenir shops. If you look a little bit you can also find local artists selling their paintings. Most of the locals are there working as waiters or waitresses. The rocks that form the cobblestone steets feel like they’ve been coated with some sort of glossy paint which leads to many falls when it rains.</p>
<p>The old town kind of gets old after a day. Unless you do research in advance, you’ll end of disappointed with the food as the majority of restaurants all have the <strong>same menu</strong>:</p>

    <updated>2014-08-18T05:20:48-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.sahirbhatnagar.com/blog/2014/08/18/a-day-in-paris</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We started the day with a walking tour with <a href="www.culturefishtours.com">Culture Fish</a>. It’s a relatively new company started by three American siblings who have a French mother. Like most of its kind, the tour is free though tipping is expected. They offer two tours: main events which started at La Cite metro and monmarte, we took the former.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>It was a good intro to Paris tour covering the main attractions such as Notre Dame Basilica, Louvre, Tour Eiffel, La Seine, le pont des amoureux, l’Hotel de Ville. Our guide Pierre gave a very nice clear overview of the different time periods in Parisian history and the different peoples that occupied it.</p>
<p>A unique feature of this tour, and the story behind the company’s name, was the stories about culture clashes, i.e., when people from around the world intereact with the locals. For example, Parisians keep their voices down and see screaming or yelling as a sign of disrespect while in other cultures, like Indians or Italians, speaking loudly is the norm. They also expect you to greet them by saying <em>Bonjour Monsieur</em> or <em>Bonjour Madame</em>. Locals also love to relax; something us North Americans might not be accustomed to doing. Life is alot slower here according to Pierre. He told us when he was trying to get some promotional items for his company, it took him forever to find anyone with a website (which is unheared of nowadays in Canada and the US). He said things are done more by word of mouth.</p>
<p>Pierre also gave us some tips on what not to say when speaking Quebec French. Never ask <em>ca va</em> on the first meeting; it’s too personal of a question. Never use <em>tu</em> or <em>toi</em>, instead use <em>vous</em>.</p>
<p>The sights in Paris are overwhelming, even the second time around. I still like the Arc de Triomphe the most. Even though climbing the stairs to the top of it will set you back 10 euro, its worth it compared to going up the tour Eiffel.</p>
<p>The most dissapointing part of Paris was by far the food. Maybe because we have such high expectations for a city like Paris, or maybe because we are spoiled in Montreal. Maybe we didn’t look hard enough, but then again, you shouldn’t have to look very hard in such a big city. If you’re ever planning to go to Paris, try hard in advance to look for non-touristic restaurants, recommended by locals. Also be aware that street signs are non-existent in Paris. They are painted onto the corner building which gets really confusing with all the roundabouts and multi-intersections… Something we take for granted I guess in Canada.</p>
<p>We stayed at an Airbnb place near metro Guy Moquet. The area was nice, with a wine shop, grocery store and supermarket nearby. Its crazy how they sell hard liquor at the grocery store.</p>]]></content>

<p>We took the evening flight from Montreal Trudeau (YUL) to Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG).</p>

<p><img src="http://www.sahirbhatnagar.com/images/europe2014/paris/IMG_6379.JPG" title="[CDG]" ></p>
<p>I tried to sleep as little as possible in the nights leading up to the flight to try and counteract the jet-lag but it didn’t work. We had trouble sleeping in the plane so we watched Hunger Games: Catching Fire…twice. It’s actually a pretty interesting movie; a comic book which depicts human nature in the face of opression. The plane food was terrible as expected. Note to self: ask for the Hindu option next time.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.sahirbhatnagar.com/images/europe2014/paris/IMG_6386.JPG" title="[CDG]" ></p>
<p>We landed in Paris on August 13th at 6 am, and took the <a href="http://www.aeroportsdeparis.fr/ADP/en-GB/Passagers/Access-maps-car-parks/Paris-CDG/Access/public-transport/paris-cdg-roissybus.htm">RoissyBus</a> from Terminal 3 to Opera metro.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.sahirbhatnagar.com/images/europe2014/paris/IMG_6388.JPG" title="[CDG]" ></p>
<p>This was a nice bus ride, and allowed you to see the <strong>normal</strong> part of Paris: Peugeot cars, highways, people going to work in the morning, apartments, factories. It’s a nice dose of reality and reminds you that Paris is more than just huge monuments, overpriced shopping and a tourist mayhem. Here’s a picture of Karen thouroughly enjoying the RoissyBus.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Microsoft Outlook web app is terrible for Linux. Simple tasks such as saving addresses or deleting messages by filter is painfully difficult, especially when you have had experience with good email clients on Windows, or even Mac OS.

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/FandagoDingo">FandagoDingo</a> for this post. Though the images below are for a Windows based email client, the settings are identical for Linux Thunderbird. When you first startup Thunderbird and setup a new account, you will see these options automatically. You just need to adjust the setting shown below.

    <id>http://www.sahirbhatnagar.com/blog/2014/07/04/cdpath-in-bash</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Instead of constantly typing the full path when using the <code>cd</code> command, <strong>BASH</strong> has a built-in feature called <strong>CDPATH</strong>. Credit goes to <em>lhunath</em> who explained in this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/670488/how-to-manage-long-paths-in-bash">SO Post</a> how to use this feature.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>The first time you do this, you need to create a hidden folder and add <strong>CDPATH</strong> to your bashrc (note this step only needs to be done once):</p>
<div class="bogus-wrapper">
<notextile>
<figure class='code'><figcaption>
<span></span>
</figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>mkdir ~/.paths
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/.paths
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;CDPATH=~/.paths&#39;</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
</notextile>
</div>
<p>Then to add symbolic links use:</p>
<div class="bogus-wrapper">
<notextile>
<figure class='code'><figcaption>
<span></span>
</figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>ln -s /my/very/long/path/name/to/my/project project
</span><span class='line'>ln -s /some/other/very/long/path/to/my/backups backups
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
</notextile>
</div>
<p>To update your bashrc:</p>
<div class="bogus-wrapper">
<notextile>
<figure class='code'><figcaption>
<span></span>
</figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">source</span> ~/.bashrc
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
</notextile>
</div>
<p>Now you can enter the folders from anywhere by simply typing</p>
<div class="bogus-wrapper">
<notextile>
<figure class='code'><figcaption>
<span></span>
</figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd </span>projects
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd </span>backups
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
</notextile>
